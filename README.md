# osu-skin-randomizer
A basic UI application which crates a randomized osu! skin from elements of other skins
## Running the program
* Make sure you have [python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Clone the project or [download the zip](https://github.com/ZeCryptic/osu-skin-randomizer/archive/master.zip)
* Run main.py
## How to use
* Find the location of the "Skins" folder of you osu! installation (or some other directory containing skins)  
* Type it into the text field or find it using the "Browse..." button  
* Use the checkboxes to select which options you want  
* Press the "Create randomized skin" button  

This should create a new skin called "!RANDOM" in your skins directory. Pressing the button again will **OVERWRITE** your previous skin and generate a new one. You can then press <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in osu! to reload your skin to the newly randomized skin.
